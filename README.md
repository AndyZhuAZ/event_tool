A Flutter plugin for add event to calendar easily.
based on [add_2_calendar](https://github.com/ja2375/add_2_calendar)

future version:kotlin on Android,delete event on iOS

## What I can do:

Now you can add alarm when adding event, currently implemented on the iOS platform by Swift.This days will add Android platform code by Kotlin.

## Example

I suggest you create a new project and copy and paste the code as there may be problems on the latest iOS simulator.

```xml

```
