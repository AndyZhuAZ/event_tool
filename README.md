# Event Tool

A Flutter plugin for add event to calendar easily.
based on [add_2_calendar](https://github.com/ja2375/add_2_calendar)

## What I can do:

Now you can add alarm when adding event, currently implemented on the iOS platform by Swift.This days will add Android platform code by Kotlin.

## Example

I suggest you create a new project and copy and paste the code as there may be problems on the latest iOS simulator.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
